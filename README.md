# Linear-regression-health-cost

🏥 Healthcare Cost Prediction Project 📊💰

🚀 Overview:
This repository contains my implementation of a healthcare cost prediction project, where I used machine learning techniques to predict healthcare expenses based on various input factors. This project was completed as part of my data science and machine learning journey.

📋 Key Features:
- Developed and trained a regression model to predict healthcare costs.
- Preprocessed the dataset, including encoding categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of under $3500, demonstrating the model's accuracy.


📈 Project Outcome:
The model's successful performance in predicting healthcare costs underscores its potential utility in healthcare management and financial planning.

🌐 Acknowledgment:
This project was completed as part of a data science challenge and is a testament to my skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, and problem-solving.
